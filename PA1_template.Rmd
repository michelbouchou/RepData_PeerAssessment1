## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
library("ggplot2")
library("dplyr")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r echo=TRUE}
activity.nna <- activity[!is.na(activity$steps),]
nb.steps <- aggregate(x = activity.nna$steps, by = list(activity.nna$date), FUN = sum)
p1 <- qplot(nb.steps$x, geom = "histogram") + 
        labs(title = "Total number of steps taken per day",
             x = "Number of steps",
             y = "Frequency")
print(p1)
mean(nb.steps$x)
median(nb.steps$x)

```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r echo=TRUE}
av.steps.int <- aggregate(x = activity.nna$steps, by = list(activity.nna$interval), FUN = mean)
p2 <- ggplot(data = av.steps.int, aes(x = Group.1, y = x)) +
        geom_line() +
        labs(title = "Average daily activity pattern",
             x = "Average of steps",
             y = "Interval")
print(p2)
av.steps.int$Group.1[max(av.steps.int$x)]
```

## Imputing missing values

```{r}
nrow(activity[!complete.cases(activity), ])

activity2 <- activity
activity2$steps[is.na(activity2$steps)] <- mean(activity.nna$steps)

nb.steps2 <- aggregate(x = activity2$steps, by = list(activity2$date), FUN = sum)
p3 <- qplot(nb.steps2$x, geom = "histogram") + 
        labs(title = "Total number of steps taken per day",
             x = "Number of steps",
             y = "Frequency")
print(p3)
```

### It almost doesn't change anything

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

```{r echo=TRUE}
weekend <- c("samedi", "dimanche")

activity2$date <- as.character(activity2$date)
activity2$date[weekdays(as.Date(activity$date)) %in% weekend] <- "weekend"
activity2$date[!(weekdays(as.Date(activity$date)) %in% weekend)] <- "weekday"

activity.end <- filter(activity2, date == "weekend")
activity.day <- filter(activity2, date == "weekday")

av.steps.int.1 <- aggregate(x = activity.day$steps, by = list(activity.day$interval), FUN = mean)
av.steps.int.2 <- aggregate(x = activity.end$steps, by = list(activity.end$interval), FUN = mean)

plot(av.steps.int.1$Group.1, av.steps.int.1$x, type = "l", col = "blue", ylim = c(-1, 210), ylab = "", xlab = "")
par(new = TRUE)
plot(av.steps.int.2$Group.1, av.steps.int.2$x, type = "l", col = "red", ylim = c(-1, 210), ylab = "", xlab = "")
title(main = "Differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends",
      xlab = "Interval",
      ylab = "Steps")
legend("topright", legend = c("Weekday", "Weekend"), col = c("blue", "red"), lty = 1)
```
